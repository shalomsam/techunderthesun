This is a minimal working project that has Jest Test setup in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + Mongoose/MongoDB Project. This project displays how we can connect with the MongoDB via Mongoose and seed the database in a Jest Environment before running Jest tests. The complete article for this example can be found on [TechUndertheSun.in](https://techunderthesun.in/post/writing-jest-tests-in-a-nextjs-mongoose-application/).

## Getting Started
To run this example locally, first clone this repository, then -

```bash
cd examples/nextjs-mongoose-jest-test
```

once in the project root first you'll want to ensure all dependencies are installed, by running - 

```bash
npm i
```

and then to run the tests you can either run

```bash
npm run test
```

OR

```bash
npx jest
```
